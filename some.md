This is not a comprehensive guide to writing great articles. These are my reflections, and a cumulation of the things I learned throughout my experience writing my thoughts and blogging about things I learned.

Disclaimer: I've reached over 200K (probably more, I don't keep analytics on my latest blogs) but my writing is not always very good. I do not claim to be an expert or that I am _that good_ at writing. Instead, this article is my reflection on writing and how to overcome the fear of getting your first write-up out in the wild. I hope this helps you.

## The writing experience in a nutshell
Writing is challenging to do. You have to think about what to say, find the right words and put them in a way that other people will understand what you mean. Writing requires a clear mind and a good understanding of whatever you want to write about. Writing is not about jamming grandiose words together until they sound good. These, to me, are the reasons why writing is a challenging thing to do. 

A lot of people, when writing, try to find the grandiose words from the dictionary that will blow other people's mind, but writing is about clarity. It's about sharing/describing your thoughts clearly for yourself and for others. Certainly if writing for an audience who has the base knowledge you have, say, in computer science, for example, it's fine to use jargon in order to avoid explaining every little detail.

## Why I began writing

I began writing when I was still in secondary school, around Form 4. I did it because I thought it was cool. I read a lot of articles and blog posts on the internet -- they entertained me and thought me a few interesting things and I wanted to also share my knowledge on the internet.

After publishing my first blog post on my wordpress and google blog, I realised writing was beneficial to me as well. My first article was about a game engine I was planning to build if I recall correctly. The article was ringing a bell in my mind very often, reminding me of what I had to do and *keeping me accountable*. 

My following few articles were mostly my thoughts on other articles I would have read somewhere else. When I got into web development in my first year in high school, I wrote about my explorations and things I "discovered" while experimenting on the web. I learned a little bit about how the browser worked, figured out the differences between a few similar web APIs and I wrote about those and published on dev.to and Hashnode. I wrote these because I, again, wanted to share what I just learned and that excited me somehow. Trying to write these articles made me do a little more research about what I was trying to explain and consequently made me *learn better*. Little did I know my articles would get the attention of thousands of people all over the internet. 

To this date, I write for the same reasons, with the addition of trying to get more clarity over my own thoughts. I write when I'm reading/learning... it sticks more!

## Tips for writing 
If you're still ponding over whether to write your first article or blog post, shaking over the thought of your content getting read by other people or thinking you aren't good at writing, you're totally right!

Writing is difficult! But it wouldn't be so rewarding if it were not... right? 

When I look back at the content I posted a few years back, they're awful, unstructured and even confusing (yes, there I said it!). This is a sign of growth. It means I've improved and that's how it's going to be for you too.

Your first article is going to be trash (maybe?), people are going to correct you but *eventually*, you will get good at it and it'll be fun.

So, if you're wondering whether to publish that post that has been sitting for the past three months, you totally should. 

My first tip will be to *just do it anyway*. *Just write that post*. *Just publish that article*. 

I can't guarantee, people will read it, or that people will enjoy it. Pick a topic you're familiar with and write something about it. You will learn from the experience.

My next tip will be to pick a style of writing! I try to make my writing feel friendly and familiar in the readers mind. In fact, this entire article is a rundown of my thoughts on writing, unedited.
Picking a style of writing is as important as writing itself. Your style of writing reflects an emotional [vibe?] in the readers mind... you want them to feel good and excited while reading your article. 

Don't always try to over simplify. If you're trying to explain a hard topic, you're essentially trying to educate. To me, it is important to not forgo "how it actually works" for "a doodle of how it actually works (forgoing a few 'unimportant things')". 

Final tip; review your content, or get it reviewed by someone else (could be a friend). More often that not, they will point out things you may have missed.
