# C Markdown Parser

This is a C program that can convert basic markdown text into a HTML document and rendered in the browser.
Markdown support here is very limited. The flavour of the markdown is described below.

A sample input and output is provided in along with the code.

```
const someCode = makeCode();
```
## TODO

A list of interesting things I want to do with this code.

- [ ] Write a WASM module out of the transpiler
- [ ] Build a web application that will use the WASM module for rendering markdown

> Just some blockquote

And I put much `emphasis here`.
